            <u>Units, Classes, and Origins</u>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Units in this game have a class and an origin, and if you put a
            certain amount of units with the same class or origin, you make
            those units stronger. Having a lot of units sharing one synergy can
            even further improve the synergy.<br />
            They also cast an ability after their
            <span class="mana">mana</span> bar is full, and some units take a
            long time with large <span class="mana">mana</span> costs, while
            some units can spam out their abilities with small
            <span class="mana">mana</span> costs. The way every champion gets
            <span class="mana">mana</span
            ><span class="note"
              >(except one which will be mentioned in classes)</span
            >
            is by auto-attacking, and each champion gets 10
            <span class="mana">mana</span> per auto-attack. There are items and
            passives that help a unit get more, but the base amount is 10
            <span class="mana">mana</span>. <br />There are also synergies that
            affect casting, such as Astro reducing the
            <span class="mana">mana</span> cost to cast an ability when there
            are 3 of those units on the board.<br />
            There are unit exceptions where they do not have an ability, but
            they have a passive to compensate for their lack of ability.<br />
            Each unit can be also be different tiers/costs, where more powerful
            units have higher costs<span class="note"
              >(There are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-cost units, bought with the
              corresponding amount of gold)</span
            >.<br />
            Units also have stats that vary, but every unit has some amount of
            <span class="hp">health</span>, starting and total
            <span class="mana">mana</span>,
            <span class="mr">magic resistance</span>,
            <span class="armor">armor</span>,
            <span class="ad">attack damage</span>,
            <span class="as">attack speed</span>, and
            <span class="ap">ability power</span>.
            <span class="armor">Armor</span> and
            <span class="mr">magic resistance</span> mitigate
            <span class="ad">attack</span> and
            <span class="ap">magic/ability</span> damage respectively, similar
            to League of Legends.<br />
            There are a lot of units with a different class and origins, and
            with different abilities, but once you use them, you can understand
            the role they play whenever your units face something; for example,
            Brawlers can absorb damage, Snipers do damage from afar, and
            Infiltrators try to take out damage-dealers in your opponent's
            backrow.<br />
            You can play units on your board based on your level or keep them on
            your bench. When you get 3 copies of the same unit, it upgrades into
            a more powerful, silver, 2-star version of itself, increasing its
            own stats.<br />
            You can even get 3 of those upgraded versions into its final
            upgraded form, its golden, 3-star form. The chance of 3-starring a
            unit is low, but it results in a high payoff<span class="note"
              >(especially if you get a 3, 4, or 5-cost in its golden form,
              although extremely tough and nearly impossible for 5-costs)</span
            >.<br />
            When a 1-star unit is sold, you gain back that amount of gold. If an
            upgraded unit is sold, there a is a 1-gold sell penalty.<br />
            For example, a 2-star, 5-cost unit sells for 14 gold since you buy 3
            5-costs, or 15 gold to make in the first place.<br />
            There are a lot of basics to get through, but this will hopefully
            give you an understanding of what to play.

          <h2>
            <b><u>The Board</u></b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The board consists of 8 rows of 7 hexes, with the bottom half of the
            board reserved for placing your units and the top half reserved for
            your opponents during combat rounds.<br />
            From your opponents' perspectives, they would all have the bottom
            half of the board.

              There are a lot of numbers, and some abilities, like Riven's,
              would take a paragraph to simplify, while traits just need
              re-phrasing. Not only this, but the abilities have a lot of
              interactions against certain items, can have crowd control that
              can be single, multiple, or AOE(area of effect), and the ability
              targeting can be random, closest, farthest, or farthest but the
              ability hits the first enemy unit coming into contact. It's better
              to use the ability and see it in-game than reading it for the

            This shows each champion's class and origin in relation to others;
            this is important because in-game, you want units with the same
            synergies to get buffs for your team. Going across the top is the
            classes in alphabetical order, and going down the left side is the
            origins in alphabetical order. The classes/origins correspond to an
            image, such as Astro with an astronaut helmet. This also shows
            traits for the spatula items, more of that will be explained below.

            They are obtained through orbs, which also could contain gold or

            unique combinations, and can vary from offensive, defensive, tank,
            and utility items.<br />
            The 10 components are: Sword(most known for building
            <span class="ad">attack damage</span> items), Bow(mostly known for
            <span class="as">attack speed</span>), Vest(known for tank items
            relating to armor), Cloak(known for tank items reducing magic

            <span class="note"

              on surviving and taking damage, the item is mainly used for

          />
          <p>
            Spatulas are unique: they can give a unit an additional class/origin
            to a unit that does not already have it<span class="note"
              >(combining a sword with a spatula and putting it on a
              non-Blademaster unit gives them the Blademaster synergy).</span
            ><br />
            These spatulas are rare, and some situations, you may not need them.
            In other situations, putting the right spatula item on a unit could
            work really well<br />
            The rarity of spatulas gives rise to the chase synergies, where
            there are less units in that trait then what the trait calls for.
            For example, 9 blademasters while only 7 exist. To get 9
            blademasters, you need two spatulas with all the other blademasters
            and be at level 9, the highest level in the game.<br />
            The chase synergies are: 9 Blademaster, 6 Infiltrator(5 exist), 6
            Protector(5 exist), 8 Battlecast(6 exist), 6 Celestial(5 exist), 8
            Chrono(8 do exist, but getting all 8 units is still a feat in-game),
            8 Dark Star(6 exist), and 9 Star Guardians(7 exist). Every spatula
            item but one correspond to a synergy listed here<span class="note"
              >(Bow=Infiltrator).</span
            ><br />
            There are also bigger payoffs within these chase synergies,
            depending on how hard it is to pull off and how many units and
            spatulas are needed. Most of these win you the game when activated.
            <br />
            The only exception are 6 Protector not being a huge difference in 4,
            since a lot of units can benefit from being a Protector, which is
            why it isn't stronger. It's still a strong synergy anyway.<br /><br />
            The last case is when two Spatulas are combined, creating a Force of
            Nature, and the effect is extremely powerful since it can be used
            with any synergy: You get to add an additional unit on top of what
            ypu already have. Not only this, but Force of Nature works on the
            bench<br />
            Having an extra unit or two over everyone else wins you critical
            rounds, and having 10 units fills out synergies that were previously
            impossible at 9 units<span class="note"
              >(like 6 Vanguard and 4 Mystics).</span
            >
            This also means chase synergies with 9 units can be done at 8, but
            there is no way you do this unless you are extremely lucky<span
              class="note"
              >(getting 3 or 4 spatulas).</span

            Plunder Planet: During combat, every champion has a chance to drop
            one gold, especially the first champion(Space Pirate gold is
            separate from this galaxy's gold).<br />

            Salvage World: Selling a champion with full items will break the
            item back into its components(i.e. selling a unit with Red Buff
            breaks it back into a Vest and a Belt).<br />

            The Last, but Important Thing About TFT
          </h2>
          <p>
            Riot, the parent company of League of Legends can "patch" in changes
            to ANY facet of the game, whether it be changing unit's values
            because it is deemed too strong, to cycling galaxies, to completely
            change the set<span class="note"
              >(Set 4 is coming in September 2020).</span
            ><br />
            They release on a consistent patch schedule: every 2 weeks. However,
            if some synergy or unit is extremely strong and everyone plays
            it<span class="note"
              >(for example if some unit spammed their ability too much)</span
            >
            Riot does also do hotfixes, which weakens the unit/synergy
            overperforming.<br />
            These patches are needed because no one wants to see the same old
            units and synergies do well. The patches themselves could be small
            or big, depending on results from the last patch.<br />
            Adapting to these patches and finding out what is good through
            research is the key to winning games. Or you could be completely
            casual and play for fun and go for chase synergies.<br />
            There are also resources that you can use to get better, such as TFT
            Discord servers and streamers.<br />
            In TFT, the world(or I guess galaxy?) is your oyster.

      *When I use this notation, it means how many units of this class/origin at
      minimum is needed on your board to activate that synergy. In this synergy,
      you would need to have 6 unique units with the Blademaster class to get
      the 70% chance instead of just 30%<br />
